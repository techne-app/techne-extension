export const SEARCH_INTENT_PROMPT = `You are an intelligent assistant that determines if a user message is asking to SEARCH for existing discussions, or asking for CONVERSATIONAL responses.

SEARCH INTENT = User wants to find existing discussions, posts, or threads about a topic
CHAT INTENT = User wants YOU to provide opinions, explanations, or conversational responses

Key distinctions:
- SEARCH: "find", "search", "show me", "look up", "any posts about", "what's been said about"
- CHAT: "what do you think", "explain", "tell me about", "your opinion", "help me understand", "what is"

User message: "{message}"

Respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:
